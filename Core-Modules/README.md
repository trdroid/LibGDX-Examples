# Core Modules

LibGDX provides consistent cross-platform APIs to interact with the system that the applications run on. 

The applications could use these cross-platform APIs to achive the same effect on all of the supported platforms, 
without having to deal with the specifics of particular platforms. 

**Organization**

The APIs provided by LibGDX are organized into *modules*. 

**Availability**

The *modules* are available globally as *static* fields of the "Gdx" class.
